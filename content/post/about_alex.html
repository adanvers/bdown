<p>I’m social psychologist who studies social interactions and emotions and uses dynamic systems and advanced quantitative modeling in his research. I received my Ph.D. in social psychology from Arizona State University in 2017.</p>
<p>I use multiple research methods, including mobile sensing (e.g. audio recording, accelerometer, PMG), behavioral coding, natural language processing, economic decision-making games, and peripher psychophysiology to answer research questions.</p>
<p>My primary interests in quantitative modeling include multi-level modeling, machine learning, and non-linear time series modeling. I’m also interested in using Person-Centered (or idiographic) statistical techniques to understand differences in the way people change over time.</p>
<p>My research centers around understanding how people use emotions to navigate social interactions, and on how patterns of social interactions throughout a day, weekend, week, or months are related to personality, emotions, and mental health.</p>
