I'm social psychologist who studies social interactions and emotions and uses dynamic systems and advanced quantitative modeling in his research. I received my Ph.D. in social psychology from Arizona State University in 2017.

I use multiple research methods, including mobile sensing (e.g. audio recording, accelerometer, PMG), behavioral coding, natural language processing, economic decision-making games, and peripher psychophysiology to answer research questions.

My primary interests in quantitative modeling include multi-level modeling, machine learning, and non-linear time series modeling. I'm also interested in using Person-Centered (or idiographic) statistical techniques to understand differences in the way people change over time.

My research centers around understanding how people use emotions to navigate social interactions, and on how patterns of social interactions throughout a day, weekend, week, or months are related to personality, emotions, and mental health.
